						<h3>Defoe's main character</h3>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">Defoe's novels are fictional <b>autobiographies</b>: the main character is the common thread among an otherwise scattered series of episodes.</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">The narration is in <b>1st person</b> and retrospective. The character is often in a condition of <b>isolation</b> and hardship and carries out a <b>spiritual</b> journey.</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">Defoe also provides an in-depth look into the character's psychology through their actions rather than by the outside.</p>

						<p style="font-size: smaller;">I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, tho' not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay, we call our selves, and write our name, Crusoe, and so my companions always called me.</p>
