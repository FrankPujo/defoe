						<h3>Defoe's main character</h3>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">Defoe's novels are fictional <b>autobiographies</b>: the main character is the common thread among an otherwise scattered series of episodes.</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">The narration is in <b>1st person</b> and retrospective. The character is often in a condition of <b>isolation</b> and hardship and carries out a <b>spiritual</b> journey.</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;" class="fragment">Defoe also provides an in-depth look into the character's psychology through their actions rather than by the outside.</p>
